# 🎓 Student Course Portal — Microservices System  
### Microservices & Cloud Computing Assignment (University of Sri Jayewardenepura)

This project implements a **simple microservices ecosystem (5 independent services)** using **Spring Boot**, each running on a separate port, each with its own database, and communicating using **REST API** calls.

---

## 📌 **Microservices Architecture**

| Service Name        | Port | Database Name        | Description |
|---------------------|------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Student Service     | 8081 | `student_db`          | Manage students (create, list, get by ID) |
| Course Service      | 8082 | `course_db`           | Manage courses (create, list, get by ID) |
| Enrollment Service  | 8083 | `enrollment_db`       | Enroll students into courses (validates Student + Course services) |
| Result Service      | 8084 | `result_db`           | Store & view student results |
| Notification Service| 8085 | `notification_db`     | Prints a simple notification message |

Each service is **independent**, **runs separately**, and uses its own **MySQL database**.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- Java 17  
- Spring Boot  
- Spring Web  
- Spring Data JPA  
- MySQL  
- Lombok  
- WebClient (for inter-service REST calls)  
- Maven  

---

## ⚙️ **Before Running — Create Databases**

Start **XAMPP** (Apache + MySQL).  
Open **phpMyAdmin** → run these:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE student_db;
CREATE DATABASE course_db;
CREATE DATABASE enrollment_db;
CREATE DATABASE result_db;
CREATE DATABASE notification_db;
````

---

## 🚀 **How to Run All Microservices**

Navigate into each project folder and run:

```bash
mvn clean package
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 📌 Required ports:

* Student Service → **8081**
* Course Service → **8082**
* Enrollment Service → **8083**
* Result Service → **8084**
* Notification Service → **8085**

Make sure ports are not used by other apps.

## 🧪 **Testing Using Postman or Curl**

### ➤ **1. Create a Student**

```
POST http://localhost:8081/students
Body:
{
  "name": "Ravindu",
  "email": "r@example.com"
}
```

### ➤ **2. Create a Course**

```
POST http://localhost:8082/courses
Body:
{
  "title": "DB",
  "description": "Databases"
}
```

### ➤ **3. Enroll Student into Course**

```
POST http://localhost:8083/enroll
Body:
{
  "studentId": 1,
  "courseId": 1
}
```

This service will:
✔ Validate Student Service
✔ Validate Course Service
✔ Save enrollment
✔ Call Notification Service

---

### ➤ **4. Get Enrollments for a Student**

```
GET http://localhost:8083/enrollments/student/1
```

---

### ➤ **5. Add a Result**

```
POST http://localhost:8084/results
Body:
{
  "studentId": 1,
  "courseId": 1,
  "grade": "A"
}
```

---

### ➤ **6. Get Results for a Student**

```
GET http://localhost:8084/results/student/1
```

---

### ➤ **7. Test Notification Manually**

```
POST http://localhost:8085/notify/enrollment
Body:
{
  "studentId": 1,
  "courseId": 1
}
```

Expected output:

```
Student 1 enrolled into Course 1
```
